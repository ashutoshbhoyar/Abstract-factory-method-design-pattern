The Abstract Factory method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

This pattern is useful when you need to create a set of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes. This can be useful when you need to create objects in a variety of different environments, or when you need to create objects that are dependent on each other.

The Abstract Factory method design pattern works as follows:

Define an abstract factory interface that declares methods for creating each type of object in the family.
Create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface and provide methods for creating specific concrete objects.
Create a client class that uses the abstract factory interface to create objects without having to specify their concrete classes.
To use the Abstract Factory method design pattern, you first need to define an abstract factory interface. This interface should declare methods for creating each type of object in the family. For example, the following abstract factory interface defines methods for creating Android developers, web developers, and managers:

public interface EmployeeAbstractFactory {
	public abstract Employee createEmployee();
}
Next, you need to create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface. Each concrete factory class should provide methods for creating specific concrete objects. For example, the following concrete factory class provides methods for creating Android developers:

public class AndroidDevFactory extends EmployeeAbstractFactory {

	@Override
	public Employee createEmployee() {
		return new AndroidDeveloper();
	}

}
Finally, you need to create a client class that uses the abstract factory interface to create objects without having to specify their concrete classes. For example, the following client class creates an Android developer, a web developer, and a manager:

public class Client {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
 
		// I want android developer object
		Employee emp1 = EmployeeFactory.getEmployee(new AndroidDevFactory());
		System.out.println(emp1.name());
		System.out.println(emp1.salary());

		// I want web developer object
		Employee emp2 = EmployeeFactory.getEmployee(new WebDevFactory());
		System.out.println(emp2.name());
		System.out.println(emp2.salary());

		// I want manager object
		Employee emp3 = EmployeeFactory.getEmployee(new ManagerFactory());
		System.out.println(emp3.name());
		System.out.println(emp3.salary());
	}

}
The Abstract Factory method design pattern has a number of advantages, including:

It allows you to create families of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes. This can be useful when you need to create objects in a variety of different environments, or when you need to create objects that are dependent on each other.
It decouples the client code from the concrete object classes. This makes your code more flexible and reusable.
It makes it easy to add new types of objects to the system without having to modify the client code.
The Abstract Factory method design pattern is a powerful design pattern that can be used to create a variety of different applications. It is particularly useful in applications where you need to create families of related objects in a variety of different environments.
